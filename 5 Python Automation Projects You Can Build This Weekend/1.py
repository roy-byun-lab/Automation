simple e-mail cleaner that will weed out promo emails from Gmail
Ever feel your inbox blow up with unread newsletters, promotion emails, and spam? What if I told you it was possible to automate all of this with Python?
Instead of doing all that by hand, why not let Python do the job?

What Youâ€™ll Need:
    Google Gmail API (To access your inbox)
    Regular expressions (To filter out junk)
