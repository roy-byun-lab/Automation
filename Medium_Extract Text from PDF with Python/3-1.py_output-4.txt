Modern working dogs
While people rely less on dogs for daily tasks than they did in the past,
there are still many modern jobs for pooches.
Because the domestic dog’s sense of smell is between 10,000 and 100,000
better than our own, canines now assist law enforcement by sniffing out
drugs, explosives, and even electronics. They can also help
conservationists find and protect endangered species using their super-
powered schnozzes.
They assist search and rescue teams in the wake of natural disasters or
reports of people lost in the outdoors. Dogs trained to warn of hidden
explosives and enemies serve as allies in military operations. Other dogs
assist police looking for jail escapees or the bodies of murder victims.
Some partner instead with customs officials searching for contraband,
from drugs to elephant ivory. Still others lead the way tracking down
poachers, patrolling cargo ships for rats that might escape at distant
harbors, or exposing forest insect pests in shipments of wood from abroad.
Similarly, dogs can sniff out early signs of Parkinson’s disease, diabetes,
several types of cancer, oncoming epileptic seizures, and antibiotic-
resistant bacteria. They guide deaf and blind people, and they help people
with autism and post-traumatic stress disorder manage with anxiety.
Living with dogs
Most dogs are a mix of breeds—in 2015, one study estimated that only 5
percent of dogs in shelters are purebred. Just as dogs come in all sizes,
shapes, and colors, these animals also come in a spectrum of
temperaments. A bulldog might look fierce but be cuddly as a kitten,
whereas a cute cocker spaniel might nip at your finger without thinking
twice.
