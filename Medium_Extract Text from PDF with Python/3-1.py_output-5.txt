This is why animal handling expert Jack Hanna recommends teaching
children to always exercise caution around a dog they do not know. For
instance, he says kids should ask for permission from the dog’s owner
before trying to pet or play with the animal. Offering an outstretched hand
also allows the dog to familiarize itself with a new person before reaching
behind its head where it can’t see what you’re doing, which might make a
dog nervous or scared. Finally, never allow children to put their faces near
the dog’s muzzle.
“I don’t care what kind of dog it is,” Hanna told National Geographic. “The
owner may say, ‘Well, this dog’s never bit anyone before.’ But that’s not the
point. The point is it can happen.”
Of course, when dogs are cared for properly and treated with respect, they
can be incredibly loving, playful, and intelligent companions. What’s more,
by understanding where dogs come from, pet owners might learn to
appreciate their canines even more.
After all, the yipping and tail-wagging your dog performs when you grab a
bag of treats are carry-overs from when its ancestors needed to
communicate with other members of its social group. Chasing sticks and
balls may be linked to the pursuit of prey, while digging at the carpet or a
dog bed echoes how a wild canid would prepare its sleeping area. And each
time Fido stops to sniff a fire hydrant on your walk, it’s analyzing the
pheromones left behind by another dog’s urine.
We take these behaviors for granted because dogs have become “man’s
best friend.” But deep inside every pit bull and Pomeranian, there lie hints
of the past.
