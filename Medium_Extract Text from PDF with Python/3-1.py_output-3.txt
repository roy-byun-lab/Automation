home and eventually bred to encourage certain traits. All of this is thought
to have unfolded over thousands of years.

Dog breeds
Today, many of the dogs you know and love are the product of selective
breeding between individuals with desirable traits, either physical or
behavioral. For instance, around 9,500 years ago, ancient peoples began
breeding dogs that were best able to survive and work in the cold. These
dogs would become the family of sled dogs—including breeds such as
huskies and malamutes—that remains relatively unchanged today.
Similarly, humans bred German shepherds for their ability to herd
livestock, Labrador retrievers to help collect ducks and other game felled
by hunters, and sausage-shaped Dachshunds for their ability to rush down
a burrow after a badger. Many more breeds were created to fill other
human needs, such as home protection and vermin control.  
Certain breeds have also been created to make dogs more desirable as
companions. For instance, the labradoodle, which combines the traits of a
Labrador retriever and a poodle, was invented as an attempt to create a
hypoallergenic guide dog.
