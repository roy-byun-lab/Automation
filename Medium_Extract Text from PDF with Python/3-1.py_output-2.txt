The term “domestic dog” refers to any of several hundred breeds of dog in
the world today. While these animals vary drastically in appearance, every
dog—from the Chihuahua to the Great Dane—is a member of the same
species, Canis familiaris. This separates domestic dogs from wild canines,
such as coyotes, foxes, and wolves.
Domestic dogs are mostly kept as pets, though many breeds are capable of
surviving on their own, whether it’s in a forest or on city streets. A third of
all households worldwide have a dog, according to a 2016 consumer
insights study. This makes the domestic dog the most popular pet on the
planet.
Evolutionary origins
All dogs descend from a species of wolf, but not the gray wolf (Canis
lupus), like many people assume. In fact, DNA evidence suggests that the
now-extinct wolf ancestor to modern dogs was Eurasian. However,
scientists are still working to understand exactly what species gave rise to
dogs.   
When dogs broke off from their wild ancestors is also a matter of mystery,
but genetics suggest that it occurred between 15,000 and 30,000 years
ago.
While it’s impossible to say exactly how a wild wolf species became a
domesticated dog, most scientists believe the process happened gradually
as wolves became more comfortable with humans. Perhaps wolves started
down this path simply by eating human scraps. Many generations later,
humans might have encouraged wolves to stay near by actively feeding
them. Later still, those wolves may have been welcomed into the human
